    <h1>My first coding challenge</h1>
    <p>Throughout my coding journey, I have been faced with many challenges. The main challenge that I had to face was building websites; which is still a challenge, today. Creating formulas, designing graphics and becoming the outlier is harder than most could imaging. With the help from new and old programmers, I decided to create a blog. This blog will be titled, "My first challenge".</p>
